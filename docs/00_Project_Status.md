## Day 1 acceptance evidence

- `AI.Factory.Web` is the only executable host.
- Blazor uses global Interactive Server rendering in `Components/App.razor`.
- `AI.Factory.Api` is a class library with no `Program.cs`.
- No `.Client` project exists.
- Project references enforce Web composition, API/Core separation, and Infrastructure/Core dependency direction.
- The EF model contains exactly 14 application entities plus standard Identity tables.
- `PurchaseRequests` has a non-unique `(SourceProductionPlanId, Status)` index and no unique `SourceProductionPlanId` constraint.
- Required foreign keys, checks, unique indexes, filtered active-alert index, and row-version columns are in the initial migration.
- Production defaults to `TimeProvider.System`; demo requires a fixed canonical `T`; automated tests exercise `FixedTimeProvider`.
- Initial migration applied successfully to `AI_Factory_CommandCenter` on SQL Server Express LocalDB.
- Latest build result: succeeded, 0 warnings, 0 errors.
- Foundation verification: 4 passed, 0 failed (3 unit contract checks and 1 single-host integration smoke check).
- `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` passed.
- `deploy/database.sql` contains all 14 application tables, seven Identity tables, and migration-history guards.
- Scope audit found zero `.Client` projects, zero `DbContext` references in Blazor components, and zero `Program.cs` files in `AI.Factory.Api`.

## Gates

| Gate | Status |

## Scope audit

- No Day 7-14 business feature has been implemented.
- Generated Counter and Weather demo pages were removed.
- No Docker, cloud, microservice, WebAssembly, `.Client`, AI-write, RAG, or additional table scope was added.
- Foundation tests are verification evidence and are not additions to the 15 locked required business tests.

## Handoff

- Current module: Material Requirement
- Current task: Day 6 Material Requirement Query
- Status: Done
- Remaining error: None known
- Last commit: See `git log -1`
- Next task: Day 7 Material Shortage by date, Late PO exclusion surfacing, and Serializable Purchase Request creation
- Do not change: locked topology, table count, `SourceProductionPlanId` uniqueness rule, TimeProvider policy, or the unclamped On-hand Available used in calculations

## Day 2 acceptance evidence

- Four idempotent demo identities exist with exactly one locked role each: Admin, Manager, Planner, and Viewer.
- Login and logout use the single-host ASP.NET Core Identity cookie.
- Authentication cookie is `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`, and limited to an eight-hour sliding session.
- Antiforgery is mandatory for login, logout, and admin write endpoints; a missing token returns HTTP 400 without exposing a stack trace.
- Eleven named authorization policies implement the locked permission matrix.
- API authentication and authorization failures return HTTP 401/403 instead of HTML redirects.
- Viewer access to the Admin activation endpoint returns HTTP 403, makes no data change, and writes an `Unauthorized Access` audit.
- Login success, login failure, logout, unauthorized access, and Admin activation actions write append-only audit entries.
- Login is rate-limited and request bodies are limited to 1 MiB.
- The four demo users were seeded into SQL Server Express LocalDB twice without duplicates.
- Latest verification: 19 passed, 0 failed; build 0 warnings/errors; formatting passed; no pending EF model changes.
- Gate 1 — Foundation is complete.

## Day 3 acceptance evidence

- `IMasterDataService` is the shared application service used by Blazor and API endpoints; UI has no `DbContext` access.
- Authenticated users can read Raw Materials and Formulations; only Admin and Planner can create or update them.
- Raw Material validation enforces required lengths, non-negative stock/reserved/lead-time values, unique codes, and RowVersion conflicts.
- Formulation validation enforces positive unique material weights and exact `SUM(WeightPerBatch) = BatchSize`.
- The single Material Management screen contains the locked Raw Materials, Formulations, and future Material Requirements tabs.
- Canonical seed contains exactly 10 locked raw materials and five formulations with balanced recipes.
- Master seed was executed twice against SQL Server Express LocalDB without duplicate canonical codes.
- API write endpoints explicitly validate antiforgery tokens; API status-code responses are no longer re-executed through UI error pages.
- Latest verification: 24 passed, 0 failed; build 0 warnings/errors before final formatting; no schema change was introduced.

## Day 4 acceptance evidence

- `ICustomerOrderService` is shared by Blazor and API endpoints; Customer Order components have no `DbContext` access.
- Authenticated roles can list and view orders; only Admin and Planner can create, update, or transition them.
- General update accepts no Lifecycle or Risk field and succeeds only while the order is Draft with no Production Plan.
- Once a Production Plan exists, general update is rejected, permanently locking Quantity and FormulationId through that route.
- Lifecycle transitions permit only Draft to Planned to InProduction to Completed, with no skip or backward transition.
- RowVersion is required for update and transition; stale API writes return HTTP 409.
- Computed Risk is server-calculated from the locked production-timing buffer boundaries and is never accepted from the client.
- The two locked screens provide filter/table/lifecycle/risk/pagination and create/edit/detail/validation behavior.
- Canonical LocalDB seed contains exactly 10 orders, preserves `T = 2026-08-04` from `SO-DEMO-001.CreatedAt`, and preserves `SO-DEMO-001 Delivery = T+3` after a second run.
- Latest verification: 36 passed, 0 failed; build 0 warnings/errors; no schema change was introduced.

## Day 5 acceptance evidence

- `IProductionPlanService` is shared by Blazor and API endpoints; the Production Plan component has no `DbContext` access.
- Authenticated roles can list and view plans; only Admin and Planner can create or transition them.
- Plan creation requires a Planned Customer Order, a valid machine, and a unique Plan Number and Customer Order.
- Required Batch is computed with `CEILING(Order Quantity / Batch Size)`; the locked cases 10,000/500 = 20, 1,001/500 = 3, and 800/400 = 2 pass.
- Material Requirements are server-computed as `Required Batch * Weight Per Batch`; clients cannot supply batch, requirements, lifecycle, or risk values.
- Production Plan and all Material Requirements are saved in one relational database transaction; duplicate attempts create neither another Plan nor Requirements.
- Plan lifecycle permits only Planned to InProduction to Completed; RowVersion conflicts return HTTP 409.
- The single locked Production Plan screen includes plan list, create form, machine assignment, required batches, lifecycle, computed risk, and requirement detail.
- Canonical LocalDB seed contains three machine references, eight Plans, and 25 Material Requirements. A second run preserves `T`, dates, counts, and uniqueness.
- `PP-DEMO-001` has 20 required batches, completion `T+5`, computed Critical timing risk, and RM-001 requirement 5,000 kg.
- Latest verification: 47 passed, 0 failed; build 0 warnings/errors; no schema change was introduced.

## Day 6 acceptance evidence

- `IMaterialRequirementQueryService` is shared by Blazor and API endpoints; the Material Management component has no `DbContext` access.
- The module is read-only: no table, no migration, and no write path was added, so the model still contains exactly 14 application entities.
- Active demand counts only `Planned` and `InProduction` production plans; `Completed` plans are excluded and contribute no Required Date.
- `Cumulative Required(d)` sums active requirements whose Planned Completion Date is on or before each evaluated date.
- On-hand Available is `Current Stock - Reserved Stock` and stays unclamped in every calculation; only the UI floors the displayed value at zero and flags the negative.
- `Cumulative Incoming(d)` counts outstanding quantity from Open and Partial purchase orders with Expected Date between today and `d`; late and fully received orders are excluded.
- `Available By Date(d)` is `Current Stock - Reserved Stock + Cumulative Incoming(d)`, evaluated at every active Required Date rather than a single collapsed date.
- Locked Case A holds: with RM-001 at 4,200/450 and a late 1,000 kg purchase order at `T-4`, eligible incoming is 0 and Projected Available is 3,750 kg against a 5,000 kg requirement.
- Locked Case B holds: with two active plans (80 at `d1`, 70 at `d2`) and a 50 unit order expected at `d2`, `Cumulative Required(d2) = 150` and `Available By Date(d2) = 150`; `MIN(PlannedCompletionDate)` is never used to cut off later supply.
- The Material Requirements tab is enabled as the third locked Material Management tab and shows Raw Material, Required Quantity, Current Stock, Reserved Stock, Eligible Incoming, and Projected Available.
- All four roles including Viewer can read the query; anonymous access returns HTTP 401.
- Deficit, Shortage Quantity, Material Required Date, and Evaluation Date selection remain unimplemented and belong to Day 7.
- Latest verification: 68 passed, 0 failed; build 0 warnings/errors; formatting passed; no schema change was introduced.
